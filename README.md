# IE-609-Group-5-
''' This repo is for the IE 609 final project submission purpose. We uploaded different different scripts here for different part of experiment done.
Overall you wil get five files here. They are as follows:
1. `Deterministic_model.ipynb` - to show the deterministic model 
2. `changing_investment_period.ipynb` - to show the impact on run time and objective value when number of investment periods are changed
3. `changing_investment_options.ipynb` - to show the impact on run time and objective value when number of investment options are changed
4. `changing_num_scenario.ipynb` - to show the impact on run time and objective value when number of scenarios in each investment period are changed
5. `deterministic_stochastic_SAA.ipynb` - to show difference between deterministic, stichastic model. also to show point estimation for lower 
and upper bound, confidence intervals for point estimation'''
